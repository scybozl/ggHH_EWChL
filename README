Quickstart:
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) type 'make' in the ggHH process folder
  2) go to the folder 'testrun'
  3) edit the input file powheg.input-save
  4) type './run.sh 3'
     (where the argument '3' is the value for the flag 'mtdep').
     mtdep=3 means NLO with full top quark mass dependence.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If mtdep=3 is used, the grid files (or a symbolic link to them) have to be
present in the folder from which the program is run (e.g. 'testrun'). The grids
are then combined into one, for the specific values of the anomalous couplings
as defined in the POWHEG runcard.

To achieve this the user needs to run

  ./run.sh warmup

once in the run folder (e.g. 'testrun'). This step is necessary whether the user
uses the run.sh script to perform the actual runs, or submits jobs on their own.

If the user executes ./run.sh 3, the warmup phase is called automatically.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the script ./run.sh will perform POWHEG's parallelstages 1-4
sequentially.  The time taken for all 4 steps may exceed wall clock limits on a
cluster.  In this case it is advisable to submit jobs for each parallelstage
separately.  Running only parallelstage 1 for example can be easily achieved by
putting a command 'exit' into run.sh before the line 'parstage=2'. Then
parallelstage 2 can be submitted; it will use the POWHEG files produced in
parallelstage 1.  Similarly for stages 3 (upper bounding functions) and 4
(generation of the LHE files).
