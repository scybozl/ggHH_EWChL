Quickstart:

1) type 'make' in the ggHH process folder
2) go to the folder 'testrun'
3) edit the input file powheg.input-save
4) type './run.sh 3'
(where the argument '3' is the value for the flag 'mtdep'. mtdep=3 means NLO with full top quark mass
dependence.

If mtdep=3 is used, the grid files (or a symbolic link to them)
have to be present in the folder from which the program is run (e.g. 'testrun').
If the script run.sh is used, the symbolic links will be produced automatically.
If the script run.sh is not used, the following commands have to be given (once):

 ln -s ../Virtual/events.cdf events.cdf
 ln -s ../Virtual/creategrid.py creategrid.py
 for grid in ../Virtual/Virt_full_*.grid; do ln -s $grid ${grid##*/}; done

Note that the script ./run.sh will perform POWHEG's parallelstages 1-4 sequentially. 
The time taken for all 3 steps may exceed wall clock limits on a cluster. 
In this case it is advisable to submit jobs for each parallelstage separately.
Running only parallelstage 1 for example can be easily achieved by putting a command 'exit' into run.sh
before the line 'parstage=2'.
Then parallelstage 2 can be submitted; it will use the POWHEG files produced in parallelstage 1.
Similarly for stages 3 (upper bounding functions) and 4 (generation of the LHE files).
